|                                                                             |
|  Your data has arrived! And with it comes a few extra steps... (sorry!)     |
|  You see, all the data we handle is end-to-end encrypted: that means nobody |
|  but you, not even us, can see or read it! So, the data in here WILL be     |
|  basically unuseable until you do the next two steps:                       |
|                                                                             |
|    1. Go to your client -> Security -> Decrypt Data Package and upload      |
|       the this zip file (the one that contains this file) or set it to      |
|       decrypt a directory (i.e., this directory)                            |
|                                                                             |
|    2. That's it! You now have a decrypted data package!                     |
|                                                                             |
|  Inside this data package, you will find various .json (JavaScript Standard |
|  Object Notation) and .csv (Comma separated Values) files, which we use     |
|  to provide our service to you.                                             |
|                                                                             |
|  The JSON files are used to store more complex objects, such as account     |
|  data, profiles, etc. They can be opened with any text editor, or a         |
|  browser in most cases.                                                     |
|                                                                             |
|  CSV files are a more compact way of storing large amounts of repetitive    |
|  data, such as messages. Which is exactly what we use them for! They can    |
|  be opened easily in most spreadsheet programs, or as plain text.           |
|                                                                             |
|  We understand the file structure can be confusing, so we have taken        |
|  the time to write out a simple directory guide to help you!                |
|                                                                             |
|  In the messages directory, the files are named after the channels GUID,    |
|  we understand this may be hard to navigate, so we also included the        |
|  channel and hubs name in brackets next to it. Please note: all             |
|  message data is stored on *your instance*, and *your account*: this means  |
|  you may have partial conversations as it only includes *your* messages.    |
|                                                                             |
|  If you would like, you can request it includes all messages, however it    |
|  wont serve as a backup, as you cannot upload these to instances as they    |
|  contain data that isn't yours. (So basically: You can have it for you,     |
|  but you need your data in *this* format to upload it when changing         |
|  instances).                                                                |
|                                                                             |
|  Your messages also will not contain any messages you manually deleted,     |
|  or depending on your instance, messages that belong to deleted hubs or     |
|  channels.                                                                  |
|                                                                             |
|  In the profiles directory, you will find profile data, such as your        |
|  prefrences, account details, friends list, and more.                       |
|                                                                             |
|  In the groups directory, you will find details for any groups you have     |
|  created, along with their roles, permissions, and any other information    |
|  hubs need to store. Plesae note: These do not include messages, only the   |
|  hubs information, settings, and simillar.                                  |
|                                                                             |
|  We understand using GUID for all identification can be hard for people,    |
|  unlike our systems which find it easy! so most clients also provide a data |
|  package explorer after you have decrypted your data. it would likely be    |
|  located under Tools -> Data Package Explorer.                              |
|                                                                             |
|  In your case, we have                                                      |
|  XXX.XXX.XXX Messages                                                       |
|  XXX.XXX Contacts                                                           |
|  XXX Groups                                                                 |
|                                                                             |
|  All of which makes up a staggaering 0.00Ub (XXX.XXX.XXX Bytes!) of data.   |
|  If you want this clearered from our servers, go to your client ->          |
|  Security -> Delete my Data.                                                |
|                                                                             |
