# Code of Conduct

Every community has thier rules, these are ours.

## 1. Pourpose and Scope

This document defines the community rules for this repository and any assosiated communities on all platforms. It is one of our primary goals to create a space that is safe and inclusive to everyone (within reason). We highly suggest you extend this to meet any and all spaces where work or discussion about the software or team is done.

## 2. Expected Behavour

1. To treat everyone with respect, even if you disagree with thier solutions, vies, or values. 
2. Attempt to collaborate, and see both sides before an argument. If it is undecided how to resolve a problem, then we will favor the more efficent, yet clean, implementation. If it is undecided, a community manager can be the final say. 
3. Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavour

1. Violence, or threats of violence, against anyone in or out of this community. 
2. Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
3. Displaying or distributing violet or discriminatory material in our spaces. 
4. Posting, or threatening to post somebodys personally identifable information, of anyone in or out of this community. 
5. Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
6. Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them, even if it's just a handshake or something harmless like that. People may have triggers and needs you may not forsee. 
7. Unwanted sexual attention, including but not limited to unwanted flirting, grouping, sexual advances, or simillar. 
8. Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
9. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
10. Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
11. In case of in-person events, carrying any form of weapon is a major offence. 

## 4. Concequnces of unacceptable behavour

Unacceptable behavour from anyone in our community, including sponsors and donors, will be met with a ban (perment or temperary) from all community spaces. Possibly without prior warning, depending on the offence.  

If you unknowingly did something, and you are asked to stop, you are expected to comply immeditely. If it continues, it will be considered intentional and action will be taken. 

## 5. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community manager as soon as possible. A list of community managers can be found in the contact info section. 

## 6. Adressing Grevances

If you feel as though unfair action has been taken against you, you may contact a community manager to appeal. You can only appeal once, between 30 and 365 days of the inital offence. Otherwise it will be considered invalid and automatically rejected.
