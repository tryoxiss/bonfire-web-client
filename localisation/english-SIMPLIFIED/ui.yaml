# This localisation file contains information about how to translate data. 
# Strings can contain variables surrounded by [] in some cases/ 
# This is NOT a yaml file (but we use the extension as it is very simillar syntactically).
# This is a lace (.lce) file, our own custom localisation and translation system.
# We don't have a full spec, and probably won't for a while, but feel free to ask
# @tryoxiss any questions you have about it!
#
# 
# For example: 
# Sent on [time:datetime_full]
# Some can take arguments, for example time can take the time and check if its in the last 24 hours. the most recent viable one will always be used.
