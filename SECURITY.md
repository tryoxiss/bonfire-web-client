# Security Policy 

Thank you for auditing, testing, and/or blindly stumbling across a breaking bug or vulerability! Either way, thank you for coming forward instead of abusing it. No legal action will ever be taken against you by us as long as you are in line with the [Hacker1](https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines) disclosure guidelines, and follow the rules layed out below!

1. **Report it as a vulnerability, NOT an issue.** Issues -> Create new Issue -> Report a security vulnerabulity. This keeps it confidental, and lets other affected people know of the vulnerability if they are in on it. This lets us work to fix it before anyone else can explot it. 
2. **Respect privacy.** Make a good faith effort not to access or destroy another user's data.
3. **Be patient.** Make a good faith effort to clarify and support their reports upon request. We have a team working on it, but we are currently a small set of people working on this as a passion project. 
4. **Do no harm.** Act for the common good through the prompt reporting of all found vulnerabilities. Never willfully exploit others without their permission.

Yup... thats it! 

In exchange, we promise to

1. **Resolve the issue** quickly, efficently, and transparerntly. While we are a small team, we do care about security very highly and it will become one of the highest priority issues. 
2. **Give proper regition**, if you would like, you can be in the contributers page, listed as a pentester, and have the specific vulnerabilites you found displayed with that. It's not much, but you deserve it!
3. **Do no harm**, if you responseibly disclose, we won't take any punative action against you or any collaborators. 

Unfortuntely, as we are a small team working as a passion project, **we are not currently able to offer monetary incestives** as rewards for major bugs.
