# Contribution Guide

Heyo! We are glad you are interested in contributing to bonfire! This document should help get you up to speed, and if you have any questions about the code or otherwise, feel free to message either **@tryoxiss** or **@khaim0919** for help!

## How to contribute

All contributions are bound by our [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), but as long as your a reasonable person you should be good. 

We do not accept commits directly to the master branch starting 01/MARCH/2023, so please either create a branch or a fork (which you can merge back), to edit the project in a way that isn't breaking to other people. When your code is ready to be added to the master branch, create a pull request with your code and we will review it!

Whatever you are working on, please create an issue (if there isn't already one) for it for tracking pourposes. When you are working on an issue, please kindly ask to be assigned to it so we can keep track of who is doing what, which makes collaboration easier when multiple people want to work on the same thing!

Also: please feel free to create issues even if you do not intend to work on them yourself, this helps us know what we need to get done, and helps people who want to work on the project but don't know what to do find something to work on!

## What we need

Don't know how how to code? No worries! We have many things we need each with thier own skillsets! All modules are watched by **@tryoxiss** and all code is also watched by **@khaim0919**, but some modules may have thier own managers. As follows are a list of jobs you could do (both coding, and non coding)

- **Code Optimisation**: Bonfire needs to be fast, if you speclaise in optimiseing bottlenecks or making code run faster, feel free to spice up any of our work!
- **Documentation**: It's no secret programmers write bad docs most of the time, and here that just won't fly. Please document your code, but if you are better at making things clear it can be helpful to format and rewrite documentation a bit! Feel free to make any tweaks, if you make a bad change someone else will just come and fix it!
- **Art + Branding**: While we do already have somewhat of an established brand, we are always happy to take contributions and art to go along with them! Especially for our offical client. 
- **Security**: Good at fixing things? We need that! Good at breaking things? We need that too! Feel free to audit our code at any time, but please publish a comprehensive report somewhere and send it to a community manager for review! Also feel free to fix any changes you find!
